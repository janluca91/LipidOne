# LipidOne
An in-depth and user-friendly lipidomic data analysis tool


DESCRIPTION
-----------

LC/MS-based analysis techniques combined with specialised lipid platforms allow for the qualitative and quantitative determination of thousands of lipid molecules. Each individual molecule can be considered as an assembly of smaller parts, often called building blocks. Some recent bioinformatics tools have been developed to study changes in the lipid profile in case-control experiments and link these changes to different enzyme activity or gene expression. However, the changes considered concern only the assembled lipid molecules. Lipid building blocks are the result of a myriad of biochemical synthesis and transformation processes that, from a systems biology perspective, should not be ignored. Here we present a new lipidomic tool called LipidOne, which automatically highlights all qualitative and quantitative changes in lipid building blocks both among all detected lipid classes and among experimental groups. Now, the discovered differences can be easily linked to the activity of specific enzyme classes.


LipidOne is a stand alone software entirely written in Perl and implemented for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Each operation is made very simple thanks to the Graphical User Interface, developed by using Perl Prima (http://www.prima.eu.org/) and Gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/) libraries. 

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Microsoft Windows 64-bit

GNUPLOT Graphic library. Download at http://www.gnuplot.info/ or https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/5.4.2/


MORE INFORMATION
----------------
LipidOne is a freely available and easy-to-use software to discover the deeper features of building blocks in a lipidomic dataset. The example reported in Supplementary Information of our study (LINK) demonstrates its effectiveness in revealing differences that can easily be attributed to different enzymatic activity in the biological system studied.
